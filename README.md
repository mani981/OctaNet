Web development Landing Page
Customization Guide
The various sections in the **HTML** and **CSS** are well commented, so feel free to change whatever doesn't suit your need.

The JavaScript functions are commented too, so you will know what the functions and selections do.

I used Ion Icons and Icons8 for the icons, but feel free to use fontawesome or any other icon library you want.

For the subscription form submission, you can use formspree since you're just going to collect emails. You can use a more elaborate service like Mailchimp or Convertkit for this purpose.

In addition to formspree, you can also use Netlify form submission in case you deploy there. Brad Traversy has a video tutorial on how to do it.
**This is good landing page (Home page)**.
